## HTML+CSS Assessment

Week 7 day 2 homework for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp.

### Overview

Welcome to my first web page!

In this project, I have displayed the ability to write text in different formats.  You will notice headers, paragraphs, the use of bolded text and italicized text.  

As you scroll down, you will notice a table which I have formatted to display a scoreboard for a football game between the Denver Broncos and the Green Bay Packers.  This table has a header that states "Scores by Quarter," and a footer that states the total and the total points from each quarter as well as the final amount of points for the entire game.

Continuing down you will notice more information about both teams.  There will be the team logos, a link to the teams website, and the first and second string quarter backs for the team.

At the very bottom there is an option for user input.  You can enter your first and last name, what your favorite sport is, your experience with that sport, the level of profession of the sport, and a submit bottom down at the bottom.

This website has now become fancier with the addition of the application of some basic CSS.  You will notice more color, and changes to list bullet styling which was all done through CSS.

### Technologies Used

* Atom
* Git
* Terminal
* HTML
* CSS

### Lessons Learned

Everything displayed on the page was a lesson learned.  Setting image heights and widths.  Creating a form and table from scratch.  Again, since this was literally my first HTML project and experience, everything that I was able to do was learned by doing this.

### Wishlist Additions

* Adding more team information and positions
* Having the form save the users information
* Make the table more attractive with some CSS work
