      <p><strong>It's</strong> beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. A beautiful little sunset. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.
      </p>
      <blockquote><p><em><strong>Everyone</strong> wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Trees grow however makes them happy. You have to make these big decisions. Imagination is the key to painting.
      </em></p></blockquote>
      <p><strong>Just</strong> relax and let it flow. That easy. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. This is a fantastic little painting. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.
